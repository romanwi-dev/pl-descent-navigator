# Step 9: OBY Draft Generation - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully completed OBY (citizenship application) draft generation system with automatic data population from intake, HAC approval workflow, and full lifecycle tracking from draft → review → filed → submitted.

---

## Core Components

### 1. OBY Auto-Population Hook (`src/hooks/useOBYAutoPopulation.ts`)

**Purpose:** Automatically generates OBY draft data from intake and master table sources.

**Data Sources (Priority Order):**
1. `intake_data` table - User-submitted information
2. `master_table` - Comprehensive case data
3. Fallback to null if neither source has data

**Auto-Populated Sections:**
- **Section 1:** Applicant Information (name, DOB, POB, sex, citizenship, passport)
- **Section 2:** Parents (father & mother names, DOB, POB)
- **Section 3:** Paternal Grandparents (PGF & PGM details)
- **Section 4:** Maternal Grandparents (MGF & MGM details)
- **Section 5:** Spouse Information (if married)
- **Section 6:** Ancestry Line determination

**Completion Calculation:**
- Critical fields weighted at 60% (applicant, parents, ancestry)
- Overall fields weighted at 40%
- Formula: `(criticalPercentage * 0.6) + (overallPercentage * 0.4)`
- Ensures focus on essential citizenship eligibility fields

### 2. OBY Status Card (`src/components/citizenship/OBYStatusCard.tsx`)

**Visual States:**
1. **Not Started** - Gray outline badge
2. **Draft** - Secondary badge with Edit icon
3. **Under Review** - Primary badge (HAC reviewing)
4. **Filed** - Blue badge with CheckCircle (HAC approved)
5. **Submitted** - Green badge with Send icon (sent to government)

**Features:**
- Progress bar showing form completion %
- Timeline of key milestones (draft created, reviewed, filed, submitted)
- HAC notes display
- Conditional action buttons based on status
- Reference number tracking

**Workflow Actions:**
- **Draft Stage:** "Submit for Review" (requires 80%+ completion)
- **Review Stage:** "Approve & File" (HAC only)
- **Filed Stage:** "Mark Submitted" (with government reference #)

### 3. Database Fields (master_table)

**Status Tracking:**
- `oby_status` - enum: not_started | draft | review | filed | submitted
- `completion_percentage` - integer (0-100)

**Timestamps:**
- `oby_draft_created_at` - When draft first generated
- `oby_hac_reviewed_at` - When HAC reviewed
- `oby_hac_reviewed_by` - UUID of reviewing HAC user
- `oby_filed_at` - When marked as filed
- `oby_submitted_at` - When submitted to government

**Additional Fields:**
- `oby_hac_notes` - HAC review comments
- `oby_reference_number` - Government case reference

### 4. HAC Logging Integration

Every major OBY action creates a `hac_logs` entry:
- `oby_review_requested` - Draft submitted for review
- `oby_approved` - HAC approved application
- `oby_filed` - Marked as filed
- `oby_submitted` - Submitted to government with reference #

**Log Metadata:**
- Performing user ID
- Action timestamp
- Optional notes/reference numbers

## OBY Workflow States

### State 1: Not Started
**Condition:** `oby_status = 'not_started'` OR `oby_status IS NULL`

**Display:**
- Alert: "No OBY draft created yet"
- Button: "Generate OBY Draft"

**Action:** Generate draft from intake data
- Fetches `intake_data` for case
- Calculates initial completion %
- Sets `oby_status = 'draft'`
- Records `oby_draft_created_at`
- Creates HAC log entry

### State 2: Draft
**Condition:** `oby_status = 'draft'`

**Display:**
- Alert: "Requires HAC review before filing" (destructive red)
- Draft creation timestamp
- Completion percentage
- Buttons: "Submit for Review" (if ≥80%), "Edit Form"

**Validation:**
- Must be ≥80% complete to submit for review
- Warning shown if below threshold

**Actions:**
- Edit draft (navigate to citizenship form)
- Submit for review (changes status to 'review')

### State 3: Under Review
**Condition:** `oby_status = 'review'`

**Display:**
- Badge: "Under Review" (primary blue)
- Prompt for HAC notes (optional)
- Buttons: "Approve & File", "Return to Draft"

**HAC Actions:**
- **Approve:** Sets `oby_status = 'filed'`, records reviewer, updates case KPI `oby_filed = true`
- **Reject:** Returns to 'draft' status for corrections

### State 4: Filed
**Condition:** `oby_status = 'filed'`

**Display:**
- Badge: "Filed" (blue with CheckCircle)
- Alert: "Ready to file with authorities" (green border)
- Filing timestamp
- HAC review details
- Button: "Mark Submitted"

**Action:**
- Mark as submitted with optional government reference number
- Transitions to 'submitted' status

### State 5: Submitted
**Condition:** `oby_status = 'submitted'`

**Display:**
- Badge: "Submitted" (green with Send icon)
- Alert: "Application filed with Masovian Voivoda"
- Submission timestamp
- Government reference number
- No further actions (final state)

**Awaiting:** Initial response from government (tracked separately)

## Use Cases

### Case Manager Workflow:
1. Opens case with completed intake
2. Navigates to Citizenship Dashboard
3. Clicks "Generate OBY Draft"

6. Manager updates, resubmits
7. HAC approves → Status: Filed

### Filing Workflow:
1. Approved OBY ready to file
2. Staff downloads PDF from citizenship form

## Completion Percentage Logic

**Critical Fields (60% weight):**
- `applicant_first_name`
- `applicant_last_name`
- `applicant_dob`
- `applicant_pob`
- `father_first_name`
- `father_last_name`
- `mother_first_name`
- `mother_last_name`
- `ancestry_line`

**Overall Fields (40% weight):**
- All ~140 master_table fields
- Includes grandparents, spouse, children
- Document flags, citizenship history

**Example Calculation:**
- 7/9 critical fields filled = 78%
- 95/140 total fields filled = 68%
- Final: (78 * 0.6) + (68 * 0.4) = 47% + 27% = **74%**

- Only admins can approve (HAC role)
- Clients have read-only access via portal

### Audit Trail:
