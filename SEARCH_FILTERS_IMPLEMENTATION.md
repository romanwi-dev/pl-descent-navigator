## 📊 Filtering Logic

### Multi-Criteria Filtering
All filters work together (AND logic):
- Search term matches name OR code
- Status matches selected status
- Processing mode matches selected mode
- Client score within range
- Case age within selected range
- Progress within range

### Performance Optimized
- `useMemo` for filtered results (no unnecessary recalculations)
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Client-side filtering after data fetch
