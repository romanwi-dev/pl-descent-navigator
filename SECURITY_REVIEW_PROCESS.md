## Pre-Review Preparation (1 Week Before)

### 1. Data Collection

- [ ] **Security Metrics** (from last 3 months):
  ```sql
  -- Failed login attempts
  SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as attempts
  FROM security_audit_logs
  WHERE event_type = 'auth_login_failed'
    AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
  GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
  ORDER BY date;
  
  -- Permission denied events
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM security_audit_logs
  WHERE severity = 'warning'
    AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
  GROUP BY event_type
  ORDER BY count DESC;
  
  -- Critical security events
  SELECT *
  FROM security_audit_logs
  WHERE severity = 'critical'
    AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC;
  ```

- [ ] **Code Changes Review:**
  - Pull all commits from last 3 months
  - Filter by security-related files
  - Identify high-risk changes

- [ ] **Dependency Audit:**
  ```bash
  npm audit
  npm outdated
  ```

- [ ] **Previous Action Items:**
  - Review status of items from last quarter
  - Identify incomplete actions

### 2. Automated Scans

- [ ] **Run security scanners:**
  ```bash
  # Dependency vulnerabilities
  npm audit --audit-level=moderate
  
  # Code quality and security
  npm run lint
  
  # Check for secrets
  git secrets --scan
  ```

- [ ] **Database Security:**
  - Run Supabase linter
  - Review RLS policies
  - Check for exposed tables

- [ ] **Edge Functions:**
  - Verify JWT requirements
  - Check input validation
  - Review rate limiting
