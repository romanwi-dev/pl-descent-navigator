## 1. OCR Processing Monitor

### Accessing the Dashboard
Navigate to: **Admin ‚Üí OCR Processing Monitor** (`/admin/ocr-processing-monitor`)

### What to Monitor

#### Active Operations
- **Normal**: 0-5 concurrent operations
- **High Load**: 6-15 concurrent operations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Alert**: >15 concurrent operations (potential abuse or system issue)

#### Failure Rate
- **Acceptable**: <5% daily failure rate
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: 5-10% failure rate
- **üö® Critical**: >10% failure rate

**Action Items for High Failure Rate:**
1. Check error messages in logs
2. Verify AI API key is valid
3. Review recent code changes
4. Contact development team if persistent

#### Processing Time
- **Good**: <30 seconds average
- **Acceptable**: 30-60 seconds average
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Slow**: >60 seconds average

**Action Items for Slow Processing:**
1. Check if specific document types are slow
2. Review image sizes being uploaded
3. Consider increasing timeout limits
4. Monitor system resources

#### Image Deletion Status
- **Required**: 100% of completed jobs should have `image_deleted_at` timestamp
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Issue**: Any job without deletion timestamp after 5 minutes

**Action Items for Missing Deletions:**
1. Review specific log entry details
2. Check for code errors in cleanup
3. Manually verify data is not stored
4. Report to development team

### Log Entry Details

Each log shows:
```
Status: [Processing | Completed | Failed]
Case ID: UUID (click to view case)
Document ID: UUID (click to view document)
Duration: XXXms
Image Size: X.XX MB
Confidence: XX%
Image Deleted: ‚úì Yes | ‚úó No
Error: [Error message if failed]
```

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| "Processing timeout exceeded" | Large/complex image | Acceptable - system working as designed |
| "Authentication required" | Missing/invalid token | Check client-side auth implementation |
| "Image file too large" | File exceeds limit | Instruct client to compress image |
| "Lovable AI request failed: 429" | Rate limit hit | Wait and retry, or upgrade AI plan |
| "Invalid JSON response from AI" | AI returned malformed data | Retry operation, report if persistent |

## 2. Rate Limiting Management

### Current Limits
```
OCR Processing:    10 requests/minute per user
PDF Generation:    20 requests/minute per user
AI Translation:    30 requests/minute per user
General API:       60 requests/minute per user
```

### Checking Rate Limit Violations

#### Database Query
```sql
-- Top rate limit violators (last hour)
SELECT 
  identifier,
  COUNT(*) as request_count,
  MAX(created_at) as last_request
FROM rate_limit_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY identifier
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
ORDER BY request_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### Identifying Abuse Patterns
- **User**: `identifier` starts with `user:`
- **IP**: `identifier` starts with `ip:`

**Normal Behavior:**
- Users make 5-10 requests per minute during active use
- Occasional bursts are acceptable

**‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious Behavior:**
- Consistent requests at exactly limit threshold
- Multiple IPs from same user
- Requests from unusual geographic locations

**Action Items:**
1. Investigate user account activity
2. Check if legitimate power user or automation
3. Contact user if suspicious
4. Temporarily block IP if confirmed abuse

### Adjusting Rate Limits

To modify limits, edit `supabase/functions/_shared/rateLimiting.ts`:

```typescript
export const RATE_LIMITS = {
  OCR_PROCESSING: {
    maxRequests: 10,  // Increase if needed
    windowMs: 60000   // 1 minute window
  },
  // ... other limits
};
```

**When to Increase Limits:**
- Legitimate power users need higher limits
- During high-volume periods (e.g., marketing campaigns)
- For internal testing/QA

**When to Decrease Limits:**
- Detecting abuse patterns
- Reducing server costs
- Protecting AI API quota

## 3. Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification

#### P1 - Critical (Response: Immediate)
- Data breach or unauthorized access
- System-wide failure
- Active attack in progress

#### P2 - High (Response: <4 hours)
- Individual account compromise
- Suspicious bulk access patterns
- Security feature failure

#### P3 - Medium (Response: <24 hours)
- Rate limit violations
- OCR processing anomalies
- Client-reported security concerns

#### P4 - Low (Response: <1 week)
- Security documentation updates
- Optimization recommendations
- Non-critical monitoring alerts

### Response Procedure

#### 1. Detection
- Automated alerts from monitoring
- User reports
- Log analysis

#### 2. Verification
- Confirm incident is real (not false positive)
- Assess scope and severity
- Document initial findings

#### 3. Containment
**Immediate Actions:**
```sql
-- Disable suspicious user account
UPDATE user_roles 
SET role = 'suspended' 
WHERE user_id = '[suspicious-user-id]';

-- Block IP address (contact infrastructure team)
-- Rate limiting will help but may need firewall rules

-- Revoke access tokens
-- (Requires Supabase dashboard access)
```

#### 4. Investigation
- Review all logs related to incident
- Identify attack vector
- Determine data affected
- Document timeline

#### 5. Eradication
- Fix vulnerability
- Deploy security patch
- Update security policies

#### 6. Recovery
- Restore normal operations
- Monitor for recurrence
- Notify affected users if needed

#### 7. Post-Incident
- Write incident report
- Update security procedures
- Conduct team debrief
- Implement preventive measures

## 4. User Access Management

### Admin Roles
```sql
-- Check user's roles
SELECT u.email, ur.role 
FROM auth.users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON ur.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.id = '[user-id]';
```

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Admin**: Full system access
2. **Assistant**: Case management, document access
3. **Client**: Own case access only

### Granting Admin Access
```sql
-- Grant admin role
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('[user-id]', 'admin');
```

### Revoking Access
```sql
-- Remove admin role
DELETE FROM user_roles 
WHERE user_id = '[user-id]' 
AND role = 'admin';
```

### Best Practices
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access
- **Regular Audits**: Review admin list quarterly
- **Strong Passwords**: Enforce for all admin accounts
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Activity Logging**: Track all admin actions

## 5. Compliance & Reporting

### GDPR Data Subject Requests

#### Right to Access
Client requests their data:
```sql
-- Export all client data
SELECT * FROM cases WHERE id = '[case-id]';
SELECT * FROM intake_data WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
SELECT * FROM master_table WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
```

#### Right to Deletion
Client requests data removal:
```sql
-- Delete all case data
DELETE FROM documents WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
DELETE FROM intake_data WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
DELETE FROM master_table WHERE case_id = '[case-id]';
DELETE FROM cases WHERE id = '[case-id]';
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Document legal basis before deletion if retention required.

#### Right to Portability
Provide data in machine-readable format (JSON):
```sql
-- Export to JSON (use Supabase dashboard or API)
```

## 6. Security Monitoring Queries

### Daily Health Check
```sql
-- OCR operations last 24h
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(processing_duration_ms)/1000 as avg_seconds,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE image_deleted_at IS NULL) as missing_deletions
FROM ocr_processing_logs
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY status;

-- Rate limit violations last 24h
SELECT COUNT(*) as violations
FROM rate_limit_logs
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY identifier
HAVING COUNT(*) > 60;
```

### Weekly Trends
```sql
-- OCR performance by day
SELECT 
  DATE(started_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(processing_duration_ms)/1000 as avg_seconds,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as failure_rate
FROM ocr_processing_logs
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(started_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Monthly Analysis
```sql
-- Top error messages
SELECT 
  error_message,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences
FROM ocr_processing_logs
WHERE status = 'failed'
AND started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND error_message IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY error_message
ORDER BY occurrences DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
