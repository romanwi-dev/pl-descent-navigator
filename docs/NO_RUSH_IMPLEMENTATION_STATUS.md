## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Step 1: Wire Up Hooks to All Forms (Current)
**Status:** Setting up infrastructure

**Completed:**
- [x] Added date field configurations to `formRequiredFields.ts`
- [x] Created `FormValidationSummary` component
- [x] Added validation UI to `FormInput` (red border, aria-invalid)
- [x] Updated `forms/index.ts` exports
- [x] Family History Form already using `useFormManager` ✅

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Update IntakeForm to use `useFormManager`
- [ ] Update POAForm to use `useFormManager`
- [ ] Update CitizenshipForm to use `useFormManager`
- [ ] Update FamilyTreeForm to use `useFormManager`
- [ ] Update CivilRegistryForm to use `useFormManager`

**Next Steps:**
1. Replace custom hooks with `useFormManager` in each form
2. Add date field arrays to each form
3. Wire up validation errors to UI
4. Test auto-save on each form

## 📋 UPCOMING TASKS

### Step 2: Validation UI Feedback
- [ ] Add `FormValidationSummary` to each form header
- [ ] Wire up field-level errors from `useFieldValidation`
- [ ] Test date validation (DD.MM.YYYY)
- [ ] Scroll to first error on validation failure

### Step 3: Auto-Save Testing
- [ ] Manual test all 6 forms (see TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] Test edge cases (rapid typing, network failure)
- [ ] Verify data persistence after refresh

### Step 4: Security & Performance Audits
- [x] Run Supabase linter (1 warning: password protection - non-critical)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: >80 mobile)
- [ ] Test on throttled 3G
- [ ] Responsive testing (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px)

### Step 5: E2E User Journey
- [ ] Create new case → Intake → POA → Citizenship → Family Tree
- [ ] Test validation blocking (missing fields)
- [ ] Test unsaved changes warning
- [ ] Verify PDF generation with complete data

### Step 6: AI Agent Alignment
**High Priority:**
- [ ] Step 8: Documents Engine (Doc Radar + Translation)
- [ ] Step 10: Partner API (REST endpoints)

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Step 11: Typeform Integration
- [ ] Step 13: Enhanced HAC Logging

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] Step 17: Nightly Backups
